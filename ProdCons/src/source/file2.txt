A blocking queue in which each insert operation must wait for
a corresponding remove operation by another thread, and vice versa.
A synchronous queue does not have any internal capacity, not even a capacity of one.
You cannot peek at a synchronous queue because an element is only present when you try to remove it;
you cannot insert an element (using any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it;
you cannot iterate as there is nothing to iterate.
The head of the queue is the element that the first queued inserting thread is trying to add to the queue;
if there is no such queued thread then no element is available for removal and poll() will return null.
For purposes of other Collection methods (for example contains), a SynchronousQueue acts as an empty collection.
This queue does not permit null elements.
